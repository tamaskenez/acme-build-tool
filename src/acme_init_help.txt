Usage:
    acme init <path> <options>

<path>
    The <path> can absolute or relative. If it's relative
    it can be relative to the current directory or relative to
    ACME_SOURCE_PREFIX environment variable (if it exists).

<options>

You need to specify exactly one of x, l, s, a or m:

    -x, --exe
        configure an executable
    -l, --lib
        configure a library (shared or static depending on BUILD_SHARED_LIBS)
    -s, --shared
        configure a shared library
    -a, --static
        configure a static library
    -m, --module
        configure a plugin

The package name is a qualified like package name, seperated
with dots, e.g. 'company.foo.bar'. This will be
also the installation path of the include files. The default names of
the executable/library and the CMake package name will be the same.
The package namespace will also be derived from it: 'company::foo::bar'.

You can omit specifying a package name if the ACME_SOURCE_PREFIX
environment variable is set and the <path> is below it.
In that case, the package name will be the relative path from
ACME_SOURCE_PREFIX

    -p, --package <package-name>
        dot-separated package name, like company.foo.bar
